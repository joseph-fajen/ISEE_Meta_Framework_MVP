# Implementation Guide for ISEE Prototype

This guide provides practical steps for developing the first working prototype of the Idea Synthesis and Extraction Engine (ISEE).

## Step 1: Start with a Minimal Viable Implementation

Begin with a simplified version focusing on these core components:

### Single Model Integration

- Integrate with one reliable LLM API (e.g., Claude or GPT)
- Create a simple wrapper class for API calls with error handling
- Implement basic prompt construction and response parsing

### Basic Instruction Templates

- Create 3-5 diverse system prompts (e.g., creative, analytical, critical)
- Design a simple template format with placeholders for domain and query variables
- Test each template individually to ensure varied outputs

### Query Management

- Implement a simple method to store and track query inputs
- Create a mechanism to generate variant queries automatically
- Build a basic user interface for query submission

## Step 2: Build the Orchestration System

Focus on creating a reliable pipeline for executing combinations:

### Combination Generator

- Implement the basic algorithm for creating model-instruction-query combinations
- Add functionality to selectively filter combinations to manage volume
- Create a logging system to track combination execution

### Execution Manager

- Build a simple sequential executor for small-scale testing
- Implement basic rate limiting for API calls
- Create a result storage mechanism (database or file-based)

### Error Handling

- Design robust error recovery for API failures
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Create a system to flag problematic combinations

## Step 3: Develop Basic Evaluation Mechanisms

Focus on quantitative and qualitative assessment:

### Simple Scoring System

- Implement 3-5 basic scoring criteria (e.g., relevance, novelty, feasibility)
- Create simple text-based scoring functions
- Build a mechanism to aggregate scores across dimensions

### Pattern Detection

- Implement basic text analysis for common themes/phrases
- Use simple embedding techniques to measure similarity between responses
- Create a visualization for showing relationships between ideas

### Result Filtering

- Build a ranking system based on scores
- Implement methods to filter out low-quality or duplicate responses
- Create a simple UI for browsing and comparing top results

## Step 4: Create the Extraction Layer

Focus on synthesizing and presenting results:

### Basic Synthesis

- Implement a simple method to combine complementary ideas
- Use a model to summarize clusters of related ideas
- Create a templating system for consistent output formatting

### Result Presentation

- Build a clean output format (Markdown, HTML, etc.)
- Create methods to export results in different formats
- Design a basic visualization of the idea landscape

### Feedback Collection

- Implement a simple mechanism to collect user feedback on results
- Create a logging system for tracking which ideas resonate
- Build a basic system to incorporate feedback into future runs

## Technical Considerations

### Data Storage

- Start with simple JSON files for configuration and results
- Implement basic serialization/deserialization of objects
- Create a file structure that allows for session resumption

### API Management

- Implement token counting to manage API costs
- Create a caching system for duplicate requests
- Build a simple monitoring dashboard for usage

### Performance Optimization

- Start with sequential processing for simplicity
- Add basic parallelization for independent operations
- Implement request batching where appropriate

## Next Steps After Initial Prototype

Once your basic prototype is working:

### Scale Testing

- Test with larger input matrices to assess scalability
- Identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- Implement more sophisticated parallelization

### Enhanced Evaluation

- Integrate more sophisticated NLP techniques
- Implement clustering algorithms for pattern detection
- Create more nuanced scoring systems

### UI Development

- Build a more comprehensive user interface
- Create interactive visualizations for exploring the idea space
- Implement user management for collaborative usage
